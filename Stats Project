#Conclusion
#This entire project was really useful to me because I was able to learn R in a short time frame. Making the vectors and then making a matrix out of those vectors opened 
#mind to what one can do with R. Obtaining the mean, median, SD, 90th quantile and 25th quantile was actually really useful in terms of analysis because of how much information 
#I was able to obtain after the calculations. Printing out the information was also really useful since I was able to see the results and put it in a sentence inside the console. 
#Additionally, I was able to find out how to calculate complex equations using R which will be really useful in the future when performing other analysis.
#Overall my experience with this project was really eye opening and I hope there will be more work to be done programming in R.
